# Welcome to Jessica's ePortfolio

My name is Jessica Pereyra. I live in New Hampsire. My major is Computer Science and I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University. I have a 10 years old son name Jayden and two dogs. In my free time, I like to spend time with family and friends. 

This site was created to showcase some of my work in coding. 


## Code Review 

## Software Engineering/ Design

  The artifact that I chose is a previous existing code that I did in my previous course. I used Java to implement the fundamental operations of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) using MongoDB driver to access my document collection. For this existing code, I had to create a document in MongoDB database called “city” into the collection “inspections.” Then I developed a function to be able to read that document and also to be able to update the document when needed. I also developed a function to delete any document that I no longer needed. 
  
  I selected this code because I want to test my skills and abilities by being able to transfer this existing code into a different language like python. When transferring my existing code into python, I work on the project piece by piece and tested it each time. I think I met some of the objectives that I planned to meet with this enhancement. I think being able to work on my CRUD functionally but using a different language was a good way to enhance my skills since this can help me improve my skills in different programming languages and not just one. Being able to improve my workflow of my program and debugging it can help with my outcome. 
  
 The challenges that I had when transferring the existing code to python is trying to make the program run smoothly. I had to do a lot of debugging and look at any syntax errors that I might have created when writing the code. I learned to do the code piece by piece and testing it instead of doing it all at once. This could of help me find any errors I made instead of going through each line to find out what I did wrong.
